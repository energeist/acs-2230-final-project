# CatSearcher

> A fun and interactable API where you can find cats in local shelters and virtually interact with them! **YOU CAN PET THE CAT!** Try petting cats, playing with cats, or feeding them treats and see what happens!

These docs are hosted on [Github Pages](https://energeist.github.io/acs-2230-final-project/#/), and the API is hosted in the cloud on Render + MongoAtlas.  You can use Postman (or a similar app) to interact with API endpoints at https://catsearcher.onrender.com, or via a local server.
